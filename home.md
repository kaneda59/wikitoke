## Starting all together
Starting up a buisness? The buisness of a few of us for the numerous other ones or the buisness of all of us?
Are we equipped.......


## Tokenomics

**Tokens have started to circulate among digital wallets over a P2P internet...
They have first been the subject of a gold rush since 2018. In their run, the crypto-currency miners and ICO tokens issuers have opened ways to unexpored fields.**

## Tokenomising?
* **Issuing *tokens* for accounting our contributions in our association.**
* **Exchanging *tokens* for accessing services from peers.**
* **Accessing tools that ease associations under a shared governance.**
* **Designing *tokens* for distributing the risk of entrepreneurship.**
* **Or, distributing via *tokenisation* social security for all without tiers.**

** How?
