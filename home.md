# Tokenomics

**Tokens have started to circulate among digital wallets over a P2P internet...
They have first been the subject of a gold rush since 2018. In their run, the crypto-currency miners and ICO tokens issuers have opened ways to unexpored fields.**

# Tokenomising?
*** Isuuing *tokens* for accounting our ontributions in our association.
* Exchanging *tokens* for accessing services from peers.
* Accessing tools that ease associations under a shared governance.
* Designing *tokens* for distributing the risk of entrepreneurship.
* Or, distributing via *tokenisation* social security for all without tiers.**
